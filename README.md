You can help make MathQualBot better! Take screenshots of individual qual problems, clone the repository, organize your problems into any subdirectory of `QualbotQuestions`, and submit a pull request.
You can also just email a directory of pictures to me at dzackgarza@gmail.com and I can add them myself.
